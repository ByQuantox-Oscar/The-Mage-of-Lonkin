# The-Mage-of-Lonkin
------
Only Beta Game will be released here!
------
A 2D Game, where you play as a Wizard. You can either choose good or bad site, depends how you like it. There will be different classes like Pyrotechnician, Time Mechanican, Angel / Demon (depends on what Site you choose), Berserk who can controll Matter and other classes, depends on how i could implement these.

You will be able to fight with skills, that you can unlock by playing quest, fishing, leveling up, or buying them in a shop.
Im going to plan 12 different skills for each class.

Also features In-Game items with different skills, they will all be uknown since you tested them.
Items will be uknown since you used them once, so be careful what you use. (There will be a special Item when you die)
This also includes clothes, but not appearance clothes.

You can also choose different perks at the Start of the Game, which can't be changed afterwards.

Different difficulty stages:
-Easy (50% weaker Enemies and battles, 25% lower drop rate, 25% lower tier drops)
-Normal (Everything is normal like i code it, no changes at all)
-Hard (50% stronger Enemies and battles, 35% higher drop rate, 25% higher tier drops)
-Ultimate (200% stronger Enemies, 100% higher drop rate, 100% higher tier drops, some Items can't be used in Ultimate)
